REASONS OF CREATING THIS FONT

	I want to have one totally free font, so I created Codesans. When I was
	creating Codesans, I want to have a proportional edition of Codesans, so
	I created Handsans. Some glyphs of Codesans and Handsans are the same.

THE PROCESS OF CREATIONS OF THIS FONT

	I used pencil to draw glyphs of characters on papers, and use an eraser
	to correct glyphs. Then, I used a Kodak Pixpro AZ901 to take photos of
	glyphs (mostly DNGs, some are JPGs), and import photos to a PC that runs
	Microsoft Windows, used the ArcSoft PhotoStudio Darkroom to cut photos,
	then generated 16-bit TIFF photos. I used FontCreator Professional to
	create a font project, import photos cutted to characters of the font
	project to generate glyphs of characters, and exported as a font file.
	The reason I did not use FontForge to create the font is, I don't know
	whether FontForge supports importing photo files to a font.

	I did not upload DNG/JPG files, because I think it costs too much time I
	move DNG/JPG files to a ZIP file and splitting the ZIP file in 1538
	pieces and uploading them onto the GitHub.

	Originally I decided to release this font under a permissive licence,
	but later I gave up. The reason I don't release this font under
	licences, is I think licences contains rules, when users are seeing
	licences, they will be afraid of licences, or they will think there are
	restrictions or requirements for them when they are using this font.
