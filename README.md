When I was creating [Codesans](https://github.com/JosephJohnAlexander/Codesans/), I want to have a proportional edition of Codesans, so I created Handsans, but this font is named Handmark instead now. Some glyphs of it and Codesans are the same.

Originally I named my font as Handsans, means 'handwritten sans serif', later I found a font named 'Sugar & Spice Handsans', so I renamed my font to 'Humanist Sans', the name of a proportional sans serif font I had created four years ago. Then, I think the style of glyphs of my font look not like humanist, so I renamed my font to Grotsans (Grotesque Sans Serif) then Neogsans (Neogrotesque Sans Serif), later I thought it is not a good idea I name my font by generic nouns rather than proper nouns, so I renamed my font again, to Handmark, means 'handwritten marks on papers by pencils'.
